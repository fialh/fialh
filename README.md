Hello, I'm Firas

Currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in CS.
I got interested in technology through simple PC games as a kid, which led me to wonder how software and computers work. Watching videos about hacking also sparked an interest in computer security. This curiosity turned into a passion for programming, and Iâ€™ve built a strong foundation in software development to help create reliable solutions for others.

My hobbies: Football (or some might call it soccer?), Video games, eating, and the Sopranos
